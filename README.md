# Kirk Ferguson's Portfolio
As a Director of IT for a large company, it's rare that I have the opportunity to code as part of my professional responsibility. However, I'll often feed my passion for technology and stay abreast of industry trends with demo projects such as this Portfolio site during my evenings. The site was built using several technologies as an example of general concept understanding for ReactJS and AWS Serverless website development in the following areas:

## Technologies Used:

Brew, Git and Github, SSH, HTML, CSS, FontAwesome, Google Fonts, SSL, IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, Lambda, SNS, ReactJS, Babel, Webpack, NPM, Jest, Chai and Mocha.
